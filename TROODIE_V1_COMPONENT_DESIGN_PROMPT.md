# Troodie v1.0 Complete Component Design Prompt
**For Design Team: Component Library & Moodboard Creation**  
**Primary Brand Color:** Troodie Gold (#FFAD27)  
**Target Delivery:** Component Library Before Screen Design  
**Date:** August 29, 2025

---

## DESIGN BRIEF

You are tasked with creating a comprehensive component library and moodboard for Troodie, a social commerce platform for restaurant discovery. This library will be the foundation for 75+ screens. Every component should feel cohesive, use Troodie Gold (#FFAD27) as the primary accent, and adapt seamlessly across user states (anonymous, new user, active user, creator, business owner).

**Core Philosophy:** "Never Empty, Always Evolving" - Components must work whether a user has 0 friends or 100, 0 saves or 1000.
