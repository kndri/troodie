-- 1. CREATE TABLES
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS boards (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'free' CHECK (type IN ('free', 'private', 'paid')),
  cover_image_url TEXT,
  category VARCHAR(50),
  location VARCHAR(100),
  is_private BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  allow_comments BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  allow_saves BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  restaurant_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  member_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS board_restaurants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  board_id UUID REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  restaurant_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  added_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,

-- 2. ADD MISSING COLUMNS (if tables already exist)
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'boards' AND column_name = 'is_private') THEN
    ALTER TABLE boards ADD COLUMN is_private BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 3. CREATE INDEXES
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_boards_user_id ON boards(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_boards_type ON boards(type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_board_restaurants_board_id ON board_restaurants(board_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_board_restaurants_restaurant_id ON board_restaurants(restaurant_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_board_members_board_id ON board_members(board_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_board_members_user_id ON board_members(user_id);

-- 4. ENABLE RLS
ALTER TABLE boards ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE board_restaurants ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE board_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 5. DROP ALL EXISTING POLICIES
DO $$
