## Data Flow Architecture

### OnboardingContext Integration
All screens utilize the `OnboardingContext` for state management:

```typescript
interface OnboardingState {
  currentStep: string;
  quizAnswers: QuizAnswer[];
  persona: string | null;
  personaScores: PersonaScores | null;
  username?: string;
  bio?: string;
  profileImageUrl?: string;
}
```

### Authentication Integration
- `AuthContext` manages user state and authentication
- Email-based signup with verification flow
- Guest mode bypass option
- Automatic redirect for authenticated users

### Profile Service Integration
- `profileService.setPersona()` - Saves personality type
- `profileService.updateProfile()` - Updates completion status
- Automatic background saving without user action

## Conditional Flow Paths

### Path 1: Full Onboarding (New User)
Welcome → Signup → [Verification] → Quiz Intro → Quiz → Persona Result → Complete → Main App

### Path 2: Returning User

Welcome → Skip → Main App (limited functionality)

### Path 4: Existing User Login
Welcome → Login → [Verification] → Main App
