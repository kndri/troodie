# Share Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete share functionality system for Troodie that enables users to share boards, posts, profiles, and restaurants via native share sheets with deep linking support.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Components
- **ShareService** (`/services/shareService.ts`)
  - Handles share logic using expo-sharing
  - Generates appropriate deep links for dev/prod
  - Tracks analytics (initiated vs completed)
  - Platform-specific handling

- **ShareButton** (`/components/ShareButton.tsx`)
  - Reusable component with icon/button variants
  - Haptic feedback integration
  - Loading states and accessibility
  - Customizable styling

### 2. Integration Points
- ✅ Board Detail Screen - Share button in header
- ✅ Post Cards - Share action in engagement row
- ✅ Profile Screen - Share button next to Edit Profile
- ✅ Restaurant Detail - Share button in header

### 3. Database Schema
- **share_analytics** table
  - Tracks user_id, content_type, content_id, action, platform
  - Differentiates between initiated vs completed shares
  - Platform-specific analytics (iOS/Android/Web)

- **Share counts**
  - Added shares_count to posts table
  - Added share_count to boards table
  - Automatic increment via database trigger

### 4. Deep Linking
- **Development**: Uses Expo's linking (`exp://` URLs)
- **Production**: Configured for web URLs with fallback
- **URL Structure**:
  - Boards: `/boards/[id]`
  - Posts: `/posts/[id]`
  - Profiles: `/u/[username]` or `/profile/[id]`
  - Restaurants: `/restaurants/[id]`

### 5. Production Infrastructure
- **Supabase Edge Function** template for smart redirects
- **Open Graph support** for rich social previews
- **Platform detection** for optimal user experience
- **Analytics tracking** built into the flow

## Technical Decisions

### Why expo-sharing?
- Native share sheet experience
- Built-in support for Expo
- No additional native configuration needed
- Works across iOS and Android

### Why Supabase Edge Functions for production?
- No separate hosting required
- Built-in scaling and reliability
- Integrated with existing Supabase auth/database
- Cost-effective (included in Supabase plan)

### Why track initiated vs completed?
- Measure true engagement (not just button clicks)
- Calculate share conversion rates
- Identify UX friction points
- A/B test share messages

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `/services/shareService.ts` - Core share logic
- `/components/ShareButton.tsx` - Reusable UI component
- `/config/linking.ts` - Deep linking configuration
- `/supabase/migrations/20250130_add_share_functionality.sql` - Database schema
- `/supabase/functions/share-redirect/index.ts` - Edge function template
- `/docs/DEEP_LINKING_SETUP.md` - Deep linking guide
- `/docs/SHARE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Production implementation guide

### Modified Files
- `/app/boards/[id].tsx` - Added ShareButton
- `/app/restaurant/[id].tsx` - Added ShareButton
- `/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` - Added ShareButton
- `/components/PostCard.tsx` - Integrated ShareButton
- `/lib/supabase.ts` - Added share_analytics types
- `/docs/backend-design.md` - Updated share analytics docs
- `package.json` - Added expo-sharing dependency

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Simple share
<ShareButton
  content={{
    type: 'board',
    id: board.id,
    title: board.title,
    description: board.description
  }}
/>

// With custom styling
<ShareButton
  content={shareContent}
  variant="button"
  iconSize={20}
  iconColor="#FFFFFF"
  style={customStyles}
/>
```

## Analytics Insights Available

1. **Share Funnel**
   - How many users start vs complete sharing
   - Platform breakdown of shares
   - Most shared content types

2. **Content Performance**
   - Which boards/posts get shared most
   - Share velocity over time
   - Viral coefficient calculation

3. **User Behavior**
   - Power sharers identification
   - Share patterns by user segment
   - Conversion from shares to app installs

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Already Working)
- ✅ Share functionality works in development
- ✅ Analytics tracking operational
- ✅ All UI integration complete

### Before Production Launch
1. Deploy Supabase Edge Function
2. Configure app association files
3. Update production URLs in ShareService
4. Build production apps with deep linking config
5. Test Universal/App Links

### Future Enhancements
1. URL shortening service
2. Custom share messages per content
3. Share templates/suggestions
4. Referral rewards program
5. Rich media shares (with images)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Share button appears on all screens
- [x] Share sheet opens with content
- [x] URLs generated correctly
- [x] Analytics events tracked
- [x] Share counts increment (after migration)
- [ ] Deep links open app (production only)
- [ ] Social previews display (production only)

## Migration Notes

The feature is designed to work immediately in development and scale to production without code changes. The only production requirements are:
1. Run database migration
2. Deploy Edge Function
3. Update environment variables
4. Configure app associations

No breaking changes or user-facing migrations required.
