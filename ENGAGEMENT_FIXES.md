# Post Engagement - Bug Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ❌ **VirtualizedLists Nesting Error**
**Error**: `VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews`
**Cause**: PostComments component used FlatList inside the post detail ScrollView
**Fix**: ✅ Replaced FlatList with simple View mapping to avoid nesting

### 2. ❌ **Foreign Key Relationship Error** 
**Error**: `Could not find a relationship between 'post_comments' and 'users'`
**Cause**: Supabase query used incorrect foreign key hint `post_comments_user_id_fkey`
**Fix**: ✅ Updated to use direct user reference `user:user_id(...)` in query

### 3. ❌ **Comment Button Not Working**
**Cause**: No onPress handler connected
**Fix**: ✅ Added toggle functionality to show/hide comments section

### 4. ❌ **Share Button Not Working**
**Cause**: No onPress handler, missing share functionality
**Fix**: ✅ Added share alert with native share sheet and copy link options

## Updated Files:

### `/components/PostComments.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed foreign key query syntax
- ✅ Replaced FlatList with View mapping to avoid nesting
- ✅ Added direct Supabase queries for comments CRUD
- ✅ Fixed user data formatting

### `/app/posts/[id].tsx`

## What Now Works:

### 🎯 **Post Detail Screen**:
1. **✅ Comment Button**: Click → Shows/hides comments section
2. **✅ Share Button**: Click → Shows "Share" vs "Copy Link" options
3. **✅ Add Comment**: Type and submit → Appears immediately
4. **✅ Delete Comment**: Only shows for your own comments
5. **✅ Like/Save**: Optimistic updates with real-time sync

### 🎯 **Comments Section**:
1. **✅ No VirtualizedList Errors**: Uses View mapping instead of FlatList
2. **✅ Real Comments**: Loads from database correctly
3. **✅ Add Comments**: Direct Supabase insert works
4. **✅ Delete Comments**: Direct Supabase delete works
5. **✅ User Info**: Correctly displays user name, avatar, timestamp

### 🎯 **Share Functionality**:

2. **✅ Copy Link**: Copies post URL to clipboard + success message
3. **✅ Share Analytics**: Tracks shares in database for analytics
