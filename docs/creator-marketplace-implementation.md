# Creator Marketplace Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of the Creator Marketplace features for Troodie, including creator onboarding and restaurant claiming flows. These features were implemented as part of the MVP with significant simplifications to accelerate launch.

## Implementation Date
- **Date**: September 11, 2025
- **Version**: MVP 1.0
- **Status**: Implemented, Needs Review

## Features Implemented

  - Instant activation upon completion

#### Key Features
- **Simplified from 7 steps to 3 steps**
- **No social media integration required**
- **Instant approval for all creators**
- **Portfolio upload limited to 3-5 images**
- **Food specialties selection with emoji icons**

### 2. Restaurant Claiming Flow (Task CM-021)

#### Components Created

#### Key Features
- **Domain matching for instant verification**
- **6-digit email code as fallback**
- **10-minute code expiration**
- **Manual review option for edge cases**

#### Verification Methods
1. **Instant Domain Match**
   - Email domain matches restaurant website
   - Example: owner@pizzahut.com â†’ pizzahut.com
   - Zero friction, immediate verification

2. **Email Code Verification**
   - Used when domain doesn't match
   - 6-digit code sent to business email
   - 10-minute expiration window

### 3. Database Schema Updates

#### New Tables
```sql
-- Portfolio items for creators
creator_portfolio_items
- Stores creator's sample work
- Links to creator_profiles
- Includes captions and restaurant names

-- Restaurant ownership claims
restaurant_claims
- Tracks verification attempts
- Stores verification method and status
- Handles code generation and expiration

-- Onboarding progress tracking
creator_onboarding_progress
- Tracks completion status
- Stores temporary data between steps
- Analytics for dropout rates
```

#### Updated Tables
```sql
-- creator_profiles extended with:
- display_name: Public creator name
- location: General area/city
- food_specialties: Array of specialties
- portfolio_uploaded: Boolean flag
- instant_approved: MVP instant approval

-- business_profiles extended with:
- business_email: Verification email
- business_role: User's role at restaurant
- verification_method: How they verified
```

#### Database Functions
```sql
-- complete_creator_onboarding()
- Creates/updates creator profile
- Changes account type to creator
- Sets instant approval flag

-- verify_restaurant_claim()
- Handles domain matching logic
- Generates verification codes
- Returns verification method

-- verify_claim_code()
- Validates 6-digit codes
- Updates claim status
- Triggers account upgrade

-- upgrade_user_to_business()
- Creates business profile
- Updates account type
- Marks restaurant as claimed
```

### 4. Type System Updates

#### lib/supabase.ts
- Added CreatorPortfolioItem type
- Added RestaurantClaim type
- Added CreatorOnboardingProgress type
- Extended CreatorProfile with new fields
- Extended BusinessProfile with verification fields
- Added new RPC function types

## MVP Simplifications

### What Was Removed and Why

#### Creator Onboarding
| Original Design | MVP Implementation | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 7-step process | 3-step process | Reduce friction, faster completion |
| Social media connection | No social integration | Privacy concerns, technical complexity |
| Follower verification | No verification | Build supply quickly |
| Rate setting | No rates | Restaurants set campaign budgets |
| 24-hour review | Instant approval | Get creators active immediately |
| Complex portfolio import | Simple photo upload | Reduce technical complexity |

#### Restaurant Claiming
| Original Design | MVP Implementation | Rationale |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 4 verification methods | 2 methods | Simplify implementation |
| Document upload | No documents | Reduce review overhead |
| Manual review required | Optional manual review | Faster verification |
| Business license check | Domain match only | Reduce friction |

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// More tab integration
if (user.account_type === 'consumer') {
  showOption('Become a Creator', () => navigate('CreatorOnboarding'))
}

// Restaurant details integration
if (!restaurant.is_claimed && user.account_type !== 'business') {
  showButton('Claim This Restaurant', () => openClaimingFlow(restaurant))
}

// Account context updates
useAuth().refreshUser() // After onboarding or claiming
```

### Backend Integration
```typescript
// Supabase RPC calls
await supabase.rpc('complete_creator_onboarding', { ... })
await supabase.rpc('verify_restaurant_claim', { ... })
await supabase.rpc('verify_claim_code', { ... })

// Storage integration
await supabase.storage
  .from('portfolio')
  .upload(fileName, imageFile)
```

## Security Considerations

### RLS Policies
- Portfolio items: Public read, owner write
- Restaurant claims: Owner-only access
- Onboarding progress: Owner-only access
- Business profiles: Authenticated read, owner write

### Validation
- Email domain extraction sanitized
- Verification codes: 6 digits, 10-min expiry
- Rate limiting on claim attempts
- Unique constraint on user-restaurant claims

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migration
```bash

supabase db push

# Verify tables created
SELECT * FROM creator_portfolio_items LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM restaurant_claims LIMIT 1;
SELECT * FROM creator_onboarding_progress LIMIT 1;
```

# Set public access for portfolio bucket
# Set max file size to 10MB
# Allow: jpg, jpeg, png, webp
```

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required for MVP.

## Support Documentation

### Common Issues

#### "Failed to upload portfolio"
- Check storage bucket exists and has public access
- Verify file size < 10MB
- Ensure file type is jpg/jpeg/png/webp

#### "Verification code invalid"
- Check code hasn't expired (10 min limit)
- Ensure exact 6-digit match
- Verify user hasn't already claimed restaurant

#### "Can't become creator"
- Check user is logged in
- Verify account_type is 'consumer'
- Ensure not already a creator/business
