## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Accurate privacy labels
  Scenario: Declare data collection and usage
    Given the current app features
    When I complete the privacy questionnaire in App Store Connect
    Then the declarations match the app's actual data flows
```

## Technical Implementation
- Inventory data types: contact info (email), identifiers (user id, push token), usage data, diagnostics (Sentry).  
- Document thirdâ€‘party services and purposes (app functionality, analytics, developer communications).  
- Ensure policies and inâ€‘app links reflect this.

## Definition of Done
- Questionnaire completed with consistent answers.  
- Policies updated to match.
