# Task 3.1 – Fix False Failure Message for Community Actions

**Epic:** 3 – Bug Fixes  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimate:** 0.75 day  
**Status:** ✅ Completed

---

## 1. Overview
Users see an error toast even when join/leave/create community actions succeed. Investigate and resolve the incorrect error state; ensure UI reflects success immediately.

## 2. Business Value
Accurate feedback builds trust and prevents user confusion, directly impacting community adoption metrics.

## 3. Dependencies
None

## 4. Blocks / Enables
Allows reliable growth of communities by eliminating false negatives.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Accurate Community Action Feedback
  Scenario: Joining or leaving a community
    Given I successfully join or leave a community
    Then I do not receive an error message
    And the success state updates immediately in the UI

  Scenario: Creating a new community
    Given I create a new community with all required inputs
    Then the community is successfully created and available to be joined
```

## 6. Technical Implementation
1. Trace `communityService.joinCommunity`, `leaveCommunity`, `createCommunity` promises.
2. Identify where toast error triggered – likely in `communityAdminService` catch block mis-handling 2xx statuses.
3. Ensure network layer differentiates between Supabase error vs empty response.
4. Add integration tests mocking success responses.

## 7. Definition of Done
- [x] No false error toast on successful join/leave/create
- [x] UI state (button, member count) reflects change instantly
- [x] Regression tests added

## 8. Resources
- `services/communityService.ts`
- `components/community/ReasonModal.tsx` for joins.

## 9. Notes
Edge case: duplicate join attempts should still show meaningful message.
