- **Testing**: Created test script to verify migration functionality

### Migration Features
- Updates existing notifications table with new columns
- Creates missing tables (notification_preferences, push_tokens)
- Adds RLS policies and indexes
- Creates database functions for notification management
- Sets up triggers for default notification preferences

## Notes

- Real-time updates work immediately with Supabase
- All UI components follow the app's design system
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states implemented
- Full TypeScript support with complete type definitions
- Documentation includes usage examples and troubleshooting guide
- **Database migration is now compatible with existing schema**
