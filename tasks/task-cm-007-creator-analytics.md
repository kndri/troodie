## Overview
Build the Creator Analytics screen that provides detailed insights into creator performance, audience engagement, and content effectiveness. This screen helps creators understand their impact and optimize their content strategy.

## Business Value
Analytics empower creators to make data-driven decisions about their content and campaign participation. By understanding what resonates with their audience, creators can increase their engagement rates and earnings potential, leading to higher creator satisfaction and retention.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Creator Analytics Dashboard
  As a creator
  I want to see detailed analytics about my performance
  So that I can optimize my content and increase my earnings

  Scenario: View performance overview
    Given I am a creator with activity history
    When I navigate to Creator Analytics
    Then I see key metrics (views, saves, engagement rate, reach)
    And I see trend indicators (up/down from last period)
    And I can select time period (7 days, 30 days, 90 days, all time)

  Scenario: Analyze content performance
    Given I have saved restaurants and created boards
    When I view the "Content" tab
    Then I see performance metrics for each saved restaurant
    And I see which boards get the most engagement
    And I can sort by various metrics (views, saves, clicks)

  Scenario: Understand audience demographics
    Given users have engaged with my content
    When I view the "Audience" tab
    Then I see audience demographics (age, location, interests)
    And I see peak engagement times
    And I see follower growth over time

  Scenario: Track campaign performance
    Given I have completed campaigns
    When I view the "Campaigns" tab
    Then I see performance metrics for each campaign
    And I see ROI calculations (earnings vs effort)
    And I can compare campaign effectiveness

  Scenario: Export analytics data
    Given I want to analyze data externally
    When I tap "Export Data"
    Then I can download analytics as CSV
    And the export includes selected date range
```

## Technical Implementation

### UI Components (following v1_component_reference.html)
- Time period selector (segmented control)
- Metric cards with trend indicators
- Charts using react-native-chart-kit or similar
- Tab navigation for different analytics views
- Use consistent colors from v1_component_reference.html:
  - Primary green: #10B981
  - Secondary gray: #737373
  - Background: #F5F5F5
