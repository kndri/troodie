## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Empty Activity State
  As a new user
  I want to see helpful guidance when I have no activity
  So that I understand how to get started with the platform

  Scenario: Empty Activity Screen Shows Guidance
    Given I am a new user with no activity
    When I navigate to the activity screen
    Then I should see an empty state with:
      | Bell icon in orange circle |
      | "Your Activity Will Appear Here" title |
      | Explanatory text about future activity |
      | Action cards with suggestions |

  Scenario: Save Restaurant Action Card
    Given I am viewing the empty activity state
    When I see the "Save Your First Restaurant" card
    Then I should see:
      | Bookmark icon in blue circle |
      | "Save Your First Restaurant" title |
      | "Start building your collection" description |
      | "Get personalized suggestions" benefit |
      | "Explore Restaurants" button |
    And the button should navigate to restaurant exploration

  Scenario: Action Card Interactions
    Given I am viewing the empty activity state
    When I tap on an action card button
    Then I should be navigated to the appropriate screen
    And the navigation should be smooth and intuitive

  Scenario: Empty State Transitions
    Given I am viewing the empty activity state
    When I perform the suggested actions
    Then the empty state should be replaced with actual activity
    And the transition should be seamless

  Scenario: Responsive Design
    Given I am viewing the empty activity state
    When I rotate my device or change screen size
    Then the layout should remain properly aligned
    And all elements should be clearly visible
```
