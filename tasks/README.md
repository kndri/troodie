## 🎯 Task Naming Convention

Tasks follow a structured naming pattern:
- `task-{epic}-{sequence}-{short-name}.md`
- Example: `task-9-1-user-images-restaurant-photos.md`
  - Epic 9 (UI/UX Improvements and Content Integration)
  - Task 1 in that epic
  - Short descriptive name

## 📊 Epic Organization

### Epic 9: UI/UX Improvements and Content Integration
Focus on enhancing existing features with better user experience patterns and visual improvements.

- **9.1** - Add User Images to Restaurant Photos Tab When Posting
- **9.2** - Implement Save to Board Toast with Homescreen Pattern
- **9.3** - Auto-Set Restaurant Cover Photo from User Posts
- **9.4** - Remove Google Reference from Add Restaurant Modal
- **9.5** - Uppercase T in Troodie Brand Name
- **9.6** - Improve Find Friends Workflow

### Epic 10: Enhanced Navigation and User Experience

## 📋 Task File Structure

Each task file contains:

### Header Information
- **Epic**: Which epic this belongs to
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Estimate**: Time estimate in days
- **Status**: 🔴 Not Started, 🟡 In Progress, 🟢 Completed, ⏸️ Blocked, 🔄 Review

### Core Sections
1. **Overview**: Brief description of the task
2. **Business Value**: Why this task matters
3. **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
4. **Blocks**: What this task enables
5. **Acceptance Criteria**: Gherkin scenarios defining done
6. **Technical Implementation**: Code examples and approach
7. **Definition of Done**: Checklist of completion criteria
8. **Resources**: Relevant documentation and links
9. **Notes**: Additional context and considerations

## 🧪 Gherkin Scenarios

All acceptance criteria use the Gherkin framework:

```gherkin
Feature: Description of the feature
  As a [user type]
  I want [goal]
  So that [benefit]

Scenario: Specific test case
  Given [initial condition]
  When [action occurs]
  Then [expected result]
```

This provides:
- Clear, testable requirements
- Shared understanding between team members
- Foundation for automated testing
- User-focused acceptance criteria

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Master TODO.md
The `TODO.md` file provides:
- **Epic-level progress tracking** with completion percentages
- **Sprint planning** with phase organization
- **Dependency mapping** showing critical path
- **Risk assessment** identifying potential blockers
- **Overall project status** and metrics

### Status Icons
- 🔴 **Not Started** - Task defined but work hasn't begun
- 🟡 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- 🟢 **Completed** - Finished and tested
- ⏸️ **Blocked** - Waiting on dependencies
- 🔄 **Review** - Complete but under review/testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers
1. **Review the master TODO.md** to understand overall progress
2. **Check dependencies** before starting any task
3. **Read the full task file** for your assigned work
4. **Update status** as you make progress
5. **Check off Definition of Done** items as completed

### For Project Managers
1. **Monitor TODO.md** for overall project health
2. **Track epic progress** and identify bottlenecks
3. **Manage dependencies** to prevent blocking
4. **Update estimates** based on actual completion times
5. **Plan sprints** using the phase organization

### For QA/Testing
1. **Use Gherkin scenarios** as test cases
2. **Verify Definition of Done** criteria
3. **Test acceptance criteria** systematically
4. **Update task status** when testing is complete

## ✅ How to Update Progress

### When Starting a Task
1. Change status to 🟡 **In Progress** in `TODO.md`
2. Add your name to the **Assignee** column
3. Add start date to **Notes** if needed

### During Development
1. Check off **Definition of Done** items as completed
2. Update **Notes** with any blockers or insights
3. Adjust **Estimate** if needed based on progress

### When Completing a Task
1. Ensure all **Definition of Done** items are checked
2. Verify all **Gherkin scenarios** pass
3. Change status to 🔄 **Review** for testing
4. Update **Epic Progress** in `TODO.md`
5. After review approval, mark as 🟢 **Completed**

## 🔗 Dependencies and Task Relationships

### Epic 9 Dependencies
- Most tasks are independent and can run in parallel
- Task 9.1 may benefit from existing post creation system being stable
- Task 9.2 requires understanding of current homescreen save patterns

### Epic 10 Dependencies
- Task 10.1 requires post detail screen to be implemented
- Task 10.2 requires user profile system and community system
- Task 10.3 requires explore page and community system
- Task 10.4 is independent visual design improvement

### Cross-Epic Dependencies
- Community-related tasks (10.2, 10.3) may share implementation patterns
- UI consistency tasks (9.4, 9.5, 10.4) should follow consistent design principles

## 📝 Best Practices

### Writing Tasks
- **Be specific** in acceptance criteria
- **Include edge cases** in scenarios
- **Provide code examples** for complex implementations
- **Link to relevant documentation**
- **Consider accessibility and performance**

### Managing Progress
- **Update status regularly** (daily standup)
- **Document blockers immediately**
- **Communicate changes** to dependent tasks
- **Review estimates** based on actual completion

### Quality Assurance
- **Test all Gherkin scenarios**
- **Verify cross-platform compatibility**
- **Check accessibility compliance**
- **Validate performance requirements**
