# Task 3.5: Fix Edit Profile Modal Bug in Settings Screen

## Epic: Core Social Features
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimate**: 1 day
- **Status**: ðŸ”´ Not Started
- **Depends on**: Task 3.4 (User Profile Implementation)

## Overview
The Edit Profile button in the Settings modal is not opening the EditProfileModal component. The button click is being registered (console logs show the state change), but the modal is not rendering or displaying. This prevents users from editing their profile from the Settings screen.

## Business Value
- Users expect to be able to edit their profile from Settings
- Consistent UX across profile editing flows
- Critical user journey for profile management

## Dependencies
- Task 3.4: User Profile Implementation (EditProfileModal component)
- SettingsModal component
- ProfileService integration

## Blocks
- User profile editing from Settings screen
- Consistent profile management UX

## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Edit Profile from Settings
  As a user
  I want to edit my profile from the Settings screen
  So that I can manage my profile information consistently

  Scenario: Edit Profile Button Works
    Given I am on the Settings screen
    When I tap the "Edit Profile" button
    Then the EditProfileModal should open
    And I should see my current profile information
    And I should be able to edit my profile details

  Scenario: Profile Data Loads Correctly
    Given I am on the Settings screen
    When I tap "Edit Profile"
    Then the modal should display my current profile data
    And the form fields should be pre-populated with my information

  Scenario: Profile Changes Save Successfully
    Given I am editing my profile from Settings
    When I make changes and tap "Save"
    Then the changes should be saved to the database
    And the modal should close
    And the Settings screen should reflect the updated information

  Scenario: Modal Closes Properly
    Given I am in the Edit Profile modal from Settings
    When I tap the close button or cancel
    Then the modal should close
    And I should return to the Settings screen
```

## Technical Implementation

### Current Issue Analysis
- Button click is registered (console logs show state change)
- Profile data is loaded correctly
- EditProfileModal component exists and is properly exported
- Modal is not rendering despite `visible={true}`

### Debugging Steps
1. **Component Rendering**: Check if EditProfileModal component is being rendered
2. **Modal Visibility**: Verify Modal component's `visible` prop is working
3. **State Management**: Ensure `showEditProfileModal` state is properly managed
4. **Import/Export**: Verify EditProfileModal is properly imported in SettingsModal

### Potential Fixes
1. **Modal Z-Index**: Check if modal is being rendered behind other components
2. **Modal Props**: Verify all required Modal props are correctly set
3. **Component Structure**: Ensure proper component hierarchy and rendering
4. **State Synchronization**: Check for state update timing issues

### Implementation Steps
1. Add comprehensive debugging to track component lifecycle
2. Test Modal component in isolation
3. Verify EditProfileModal props are correctly passed
4. Check for any CSS/styling issues affecting modal visibility
5. Test on both iOS and Android platforms
6. Add error boundaries to catch any rendering errors

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Edit Profile button opens modal from Settings screen
- [ ] Modal displays current profile data correctly
- [ ] Profile changes save successfully
- [ ] Modal closes properly
- [ ] No console errors during modal operation
- [ ] Works consistently on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Debugging logs removed
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Notes
- Current debugging shows button click works and profile data loads
- Issue appears to be with modal rendering/visibility
- Need to investigate React Native Modal component behavior
- Consider testing with a simple modal first to isolate the issue
