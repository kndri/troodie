# UGC Reporting and User Blocking

**Epic**: 12 â€“ App Store Readiness & Compliance  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimate**: 2.0 days  
**Status**: âœ… Completed

## Overview
Add abuse reporting and user blocking for userâ€‘generated content (UGC). Required by Apple Guideline 1.2 for apps with UGC.

## Business Value
- Enables App Store approval and reduces moderation risk.  
- Improves community health and user safety.

## Dependencies
- Existing post/comment/user entities  
- `components/community/ReasonModal.tsx` available for input

## Blocks
- None

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Report content and block users
  As a user
  I want to report abusive content and block users
  So that I can avoid harmful content and notify moderators

  Scenario: Report a post
    Given I am viewing a post
    When I tap "Report" and submit a reason
    Then a report is created serverâ€‘side with my user id and the post id
    And I see a confirmation toast

  Scenario: Block a user
    Given I am on a user's profile
    When I tap "Block user" and confirm
    Then that user's content no longer appears in my feeds and search results

  Scenario: Unblock a user
    Given I have previously blocked a user
    When I tap "Unblock"
    Then their content is visible again
```

## Technical Implementation
- DB:
  - Create `reports` table: id, reporter_id, target_type (post/comment/user), target_id, reason, status (open/resolved), created_at.
  - Create `blocked_users` table: blocker_id, blocked_id, created_at (composite PK).
- Edge Functions:
  - `submit-report`: Auth required; validate target; insert report; return success.
  - `block-user` / `unblock-user`: Insert/delete rows; return success.
- UI:
  - Add overflow menu actions on post/comment/user cards to open `ReasonModal` and call `submit-report`.
  - Add Block/Unblock on `app/user/[id].tsx` and contextual menus.
  - Update feed/search queries to exclude blocked users (add where clause join on `blocked_users`).

## Definition of Done
- Report and block APIs deployed and secured (RLS/Edge).  
- UI actions present on post/comment/user; optimistic feedback provided.  
- Feeds/search exclude blocked content.  
- QA scenarios pass on iOS/Android.
