## Overview
Build the Earnings screen where creators can view their earnings history, pending payouts, and payment settings. This screen provides transparency into creator compensation and facilitates the payout process.

## Business Value
The Earnings screen builds trust with creators by providing clear visibility into their compensation. Transparent earnings tracking and reliable payouts are critical for creator retention and platform credibility.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: Creator Earnings Management
  As a creator
  I want to track my earnings and manage payouts
  So that I can understand my income and get paid reliably

  Scenario: View earnings overview
    Given I am a creator with earnings history
    When I navigate to the Earnings screen
    Then I see my total earnings (lifetime)
    And I see current month earnings
    And I see pending payout amount
    And I see available balance

  Scenario: Review earnings history
    Given I have completed campaigns with earnings
    When I scroll through the earnings list
    Then I see each earning entry with campaign name, date, and amount
    And I can filter by date range
    And I can see the payment status (pending, processing, paid)

  Scenario: Request payout
    Given I have available balance above minimum threshold ($25)
    When I tap "Request Payout"
    Then I see my connected payment method (Stripe)
    And I can confirm the payout amount
    And I receive confirmation when payout is initiated

  Scenario: Setup payment method
    Given I haven't connected a payment method
    When I tap "Setup Payments"
    Then I am guided through Stripe Connect onboarding
    And my account is verified for payouts

  Scenario: View payout history
    Given I have received previous payouts
    When I tap on "Payout History"
    Then I see all past payouts with dates and amounts
    And I can see transaction IDs for reference
```
