# Task 6.6: Fix Login Redirect Logic - COMPLETED

## Summary
Fixed the login flow to properly redirect users based on their onboarding completion status. Users who have already completed onboarding are now redirected to the main app instead of the quiz page.

## Problem
When users logged back in after completing onboarding, they were incorrectly redirected to the quiz page instead of the main app tabs.

## Root Cause
1. The verify.tsx was checking `profile?.persona` immediately after OTP verification, but the profile wasn't loaded yet
2. The index.tsx wasn't checking authentication status before routing
3. Profile completion percentage wasn't being set to 100% when onboarding was completed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated verify.tsx
- Added proper profile fetching after successful OTP verification
- Added delay to ensure auth state is properly set
- Check both persona AND profile_completion >= 100% to determine if onboarding is complete
- Set AsyncStorage flag when user has completed onboarding

### 2. Updated index.tsx
- Added authentication check using useAuth hook
- For authenticated users, fetch profile and check onboarding completion
- Proper routing logic:
  - Authenticated + completed onboarding → main app
  - Authenticated + incomplete onboarding → quiz
  - Not authenticated + previously completed → login
  - Not authenticated + new user → splash

### 3. Updated complete.tsx
- Set profile_completion to 100% when onboarding is finished
- Ensures future logins can properly detect completed onboarding

## Files Modified
1. `app/onboarding/verify.tsx` - Fixed login redirect logic
2. `app/index.tsx` - Added proper auth and onboarding checks
3. `app/onboarding/complete.tsx` - Set profile completion to 100%

## Testing Instructions
1. Complete onboarding as a new user
2. Log out of the app
3. Log back in with the same email
4. Verify you're taken directly to the main app (tabs) instead of the quiz

## Verification
- ✅ Login flow properly checks user profile completion
- ✅ Profile completion is set to 100% on onboarding completion
- ✅ AsyncStorage flag is set for completed onboarding
- ✅ Proper routing based on auth and onboarding status
