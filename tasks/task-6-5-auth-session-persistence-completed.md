# Task 6.5: Fix Authentication Session Persistence - COMPLETED

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive fix for authentication session persistence issues where users were being logged out after app refresh/reload despite having valid Supabase sessions.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Race Condition**: `getSession()` was being called before AsyncStorage was fully initialized
2. **Missing Session Refresh**: The auth context wasn't attempting to refresh expired sessions on startup
3. **Incomplete State Management**: Auth state changes weren't being handled properly for all events

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Session Initialization (AuthContext.tsx)
- Added a 100ms delay to prevent race conditions with AsyncStorage
- Implemented multiple recovery methods:
  - Primary: `getSession()` 
  - Fallback 1: `refreshSession()` if no session found
  - Fallback 2: Manual restoration from AsyncStorage
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Improved Supabase Configuration (lib/supabase.ts)
- Added explicit `storageKey` for consistent storage
- Configured `sessionAutoRefreshInterval` for better token management

### 3. Session Persistence Utilities
- Created `utils/sessionPersistence.ts` with manual save/restore capabilities
- Created `utils/debugStorage.ts` for debugging AsyncStorage contents
- Added manual session saving after successful authentication events

### 4. Enhanced Auth State Management
- Improved `onAuthStateChange` handler to prevent state overwrites
- Added explicit session saving on SIGNED_IN and TOKEN_REFRESHED events
- Added session saving after OTP verification

### 5. Debug Tools
- Created `SessionDebugger` component for testing session persistence
- Added detailed logging throughout the auth flow

## Files Modified
1. `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced session initialization and state management
2. `lib/supabase.ts` - Added explicit storage configuration
3. `utils/sessionPersistence.ts` - NEW: Manual session persistence helpers
4. `utils/debugStorage.ts` - NEW: AsyncStorage debugging utilities
5. `components/debug/SessionDebugger.tsx` - NEW: Debug component for testing

## Testing Instructions
1. Login to the app
2. Check console logs for session initialization
3. Refresh the app (Cmd+R in simulator)
4. Verify user remains logged in
5. Close and reopen the app
6. Verify user remains logged in

## Additional Notes
- The fix uses multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure session persistence
- Manual session saving provides an extra layer of reliability
- Debug tools can be removed in production builds
- Session expiry is handled gracefully with automatic refresh

## Verification Checklist
- ✅ Enhanced logging added to track session lifecycle
- ✅ AsyncStorage contents can be inspected directly
- ✅ Supabase client configuration verified and enhanced
- ✅ Session restoration fix implemented with multiple fallbacks
- ✅ Ready for testing across different scenarios

## Next Steps
- Test on physical devices (iOS and Android)
- Monitor production logs for any edge cases
- Consider implementing session expiry warnings for better UX
