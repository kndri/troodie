## Acceptance Criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Simplified Profile Data Structure
  As a developer
  I want to remove unnecessary profile fields
  So that the profile editing experience is streamlined

  Scenario: EditProfileModal Has Simplified Fields
    Given I am editing my profile
    When I open the EditProfileModal
    Then I should see only essential fields:
      | username |
      | bio |
      | profile image |
    And I should NOT see:
      | website |
      | instagram |
      | email preferences |

  Scenario: Profile Data Shape Updated
    Given I am working with profile data
    When I access profile information
    Then the data structure should exclude:
      | website |
      | instagram_handle |
      | email_preferences |
    And the database schema should be updated accordingly

Feature: Onboarding Profile Setup Flow
  As a new user
  I want to set up my profile during onboarding
  So that I have a complete profile from the start

  Scenario: Profile Image Upload Screen
    Given I am in the onboarding flow
    When I reach the profile setup section
    Then I should see a dedicated screen for profile image
    And I should be able to upload an image or skip
    And the screen should have clear instructions

  Scenario: Username Setup Screen
    Given I am setting up my profile during onboarding
    When I reach the username screen
    Then I should see a dedicated screen for username
    And I should be able to enter a unique username
    And the system should validate username availability
    And I should see clear error messages for invalid usernames

  Scenario: Bio Setup Screen
    Given I am setting up my profile during onboarding
    When I reach the bio screen
    Then I should see a dedicated screen for bio
    And I should be able to enter a bio (optional)
    And I should see character count and limits
    And I should be able to skip if desired

  Scenario: Onboarding Flow Integration
    Given I am completing the onboarding flow
    When I finish the persona quiz
    Then I should be guided through profile setup screens
    And each screen should have clear navigation
    And I should be able to go back and edit previous screens
    And the flow should save progress appropriately
```
