# Task 6.13: Improve Board Detail Screen and Create Post Screen UI

## Overview
Enhance the visual design, user experience, and consistency of the Board Detail Screen and Create Post Screen to align with the established design system and improve usability. This includes implementing proper design tokens, improving layout consistency, enhancing visual hierarchy, and optimizing the user flow.

## Business Value
- **Improved User Experience**: Better visual design increases user engagement and satisfaction
- **Design Consistency**: Unified design language across all screens builds brand trust
- **Reduced Friction**: Optimized layouts and interactions reduce user drop-off rates
- **Professional Appearance**: Polished UI enhances app credibility and user retention
- **Accessibility**: Better contrast, spacing, and typography improve accessibility compliance

## Dependencies
- Task 4.1 (Board Creation & Management) - for board functionality integration
- Task 6.2 (Post Creation & Management) - for post functionality integration
- Existing design system in `constants/designTokens.ts` and `constants/theme.ts`

## Blocks
- Future UI improvements for other screens
- Enhanced user onboarding experience
- Improved conversion rates for board and post creation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Gherkin Scenarios

**Scenario: Board Detail Screen - Improved Visual Hierarchy**
```
Given I am on the board details screen
When I view the screen layout
Then I should see clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing
And the board type indicator should be prominently displayed
And form sections should be clearly separated
And the create button should be visually prominent
```

**Scenario: Board Detail Screen - Enhanced Form Experience**
```
Given I am filling out board details
When I interact with form fields
Then input fields should have proper focus states
And validation feedback should be clear and immediate
And the form should be keyboard-friendly
And required fields should be clearly indicated
```

**Scenario: Create Post Screen - Improved Photo Management**
```
Given I am creating a post with photos
When I add or remove photos
Then the photo grid should be visually appealing
And photo removal should be intuitive
And the add photo button should be clearly visible
And photo previews should be properly sized
```

**Scenario: Create Post Screen - Enhanced Restaurant Selection**
```
Given I am selecting a restaurant for my post
When I search for restaurants
Then the search results should be well-formatted
And restaurant information should be clearly displayed
And the selection process should be smooth
And selected restaurant should be prominently shown
```

**Scenario: Consistent Design Language**
```
Given I am using both screens
When I navigate between them
Then the design language should be consistent
And typography should follow the design system
And colors should match the brand palette
And spacing should be uniform throughout
```

**Scenario: Accessibility Improvements**
```
Given I am using the app with accessibility features
When I interact with form elements
Then all interactive elements should have proper labels
And color contrast should meet WCAG guidelines
And touch targets should be appropriately sized
And screen readers should properly announce content
```

  },
  sectionTitle: {
    ...designTokens.typography.sectionTitle,

```typescript
// Use semantic colors from designTokens
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  primaryButton: {
    backgroundColor: designTokens.colors.primaryOrange,
    borderColor: designTokens.colors.primaryOrange,
  },
  secondaryButton: {
    backgroundColor: designTokens.colors.white,
    borderColor: designTokens.colors.borderLight,
  },
  inputField: {
    borderColor: designTokens.colors.borderLight,
    backgroundColor: designTokens.colors.white,
  },
});
```

#### 3. Spacing and Layout
```typescript
// Use consistent spacing from designTokens
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    paddingHorizontal: designTokens.spacing.lg,
    paddingVertical: designTokens.spacing.md,
  },
  section: {
    marginBottom: designTokens.spacing.xl,
  },
  formField: {
    marginBottom: designTokens.spacing.md,
  },
});
```

### Design System Alignment
- Both screens currently mix old and new design patterns
- Need to fully migrate to designTokens system
- Typography hierarchy needs improvement
- Color usage should be more consistent

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Implement proper lazy loading for lists
- Minimize re-renders in form components
- Use proper memoization for expensive operations

### Future Enhancements
- Consider adding animations for state transitions
- Implement gesture-based interactions
- Add haptic feedback for important actions
- Consider dark mode support
