```gherkin
Feature: Post Engagement

  Scenario: User likes a post
    Given I am logged in and viewing a post
    When I click the like button
    Then the like button changes to an active state
    And the like count for the post increases by one
    And an entry appears in the activity feed showing I liked the post

  Scenario: User comments on a post
    Given I am viewing the post detail screen
    When I type a comment into the input field and submit it
    Then my new comment appears at the top of the comment list
    And the comment is visible to other users
    And an entry appears in the activity feed showing I commented on a post

  Scenario: User saves a post
    Given I am viewing a post
    When I click the save button
    Then the save button changes to an active state
    And the post is added to my personal "Saved Posts" collection
    And an entry appears in the activity feed showing I saved the post

  Scenario: User shares a post
    Given I am viewing a post
    When I click the share button
    Then a pop-up appears with options to share the post
    And I can copy a direct link to the post detail screen
```

## 6. Technical Implementation
### 6.1 Like / Unlike
1. **UI**: Add `LikeButton` to `PostCard` and `PostDetail` (heart icon).
2. **State**: Local optimistic update via `usePostEngagement` hook.
3. **API**: `POST /posts/{id}/like` and `DELETE /posts/{id}/like` (Supabase RPC). Table `post_likes(user_id, post_id, created_at)`.
4. **Activity**: Supabase trigger inserts into `activity_feed`.

### 6.2 Comment
1. `CommentSection` component with emoji-aware text input.
2. API endpoint `POST /posts/{id}/comment` inserts into `post_comments` table.
3. Real-time subscription for new comments.

### 6.3 Save / Bookmark
1. `SaveButton` (bookmark) component with filled/outline states.
2. `saved_posts(user_id, post_id)` table + `POST /posts/{id}/save` & `DELETE`.
3. Add ‚ÄúSaved Posts‚Äù list under user profile (future task).

### 6.4 Share
1. `ShareButton` utilises `Linking` + `Share` API (expo).
2. Generate deep-link URL: `troodie://post/{id}`; web fallback `/posts/{id}`.
3. Add copy-to-clipboard and native share-sheet options.
