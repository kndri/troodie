## 📈 Design System Compliance Audit

### Current Compliance by Category:
- **Color System**: 45% compliant (inconsistent use of Troodie Orange)
- **Typography**: 35% compliant (multiple font sizes, inconsistent hierarchy)
- **Spacing**: 25% compliant (not using 4pt grid consistently)
- **Components**: 40% compliant (custom one-offs instead of system components)
- **Interactions**: 20% compliant (no consistent micro-interactions)

### Most Common Violations:
1. **Incorrect Orange Usage**: Using #FF8C00 for non-primary actions
2. **Spacing Chaos**: Random padding values instead of 4pt multiples
3. **Typography Anarchy**: 15+ different text styles instead of defined scale
4. **Shadow Inconsistency**: Multiple shadow styles instead of standard
5. **Border Radius Mix**: Using 4px, 6px, 10px instead of defined tokens

## 🎨 Redesign Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. ✅ **Home Feed** - Complete redesign with social signals
2. **Save Flow** - One-tap save implementation
3. **Restaurant Detail** - Information hierarchy fix

### Phase 2: Activation (Week 3-4)
1. **Onboarding Flow** - Progressive value demonstration
2. **Explore** - Personalized discovery
3. **Activity Feed** - Real-time social engagement

### Phase 3: Engagement (Week 5-6)
1. **Profile** - Journey narrative design
2. **Create Post** - Simplified flow
3. **Board Management** - Visual refresh

### Phase 4: Monetization (Week 7-8)
1. **Creator Hub** - New screen design
2. **Campaign Dashboard** - Restaurant tools
3. **Analytics** - Data visualization

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs:
- **Onboarding Completion**: Target 75% (from 32%)
- **First Save**: Within 3 minutes (from 8 minutes)
- **Friend Connections**: 5+ in first week (from 2)
- **DAU/MAU**: Target 35% (from 15%)

### Screen-Specific Metrics:

## 🚦 Design System Migration Strategy

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Create component library** in code matching extended design guide
2. **Establish color constants** file with correct hex values
3. **Implement spacing tokens** as constants
4. **Build reusable components** for cards, buttons, navigation

### Migration Approach:
- **New screens**: 100% design system compliance required
- **Updated screens**: Migrate during redesign
- **Existing screens**: Gradual migration based on priority

## 📝 Notes & Observations

### Critical Missing Features:
1. **No Creator Marketplace** - Core monetization missing
2. **No Attribution System** - Can't prove ROI
3. **No Social Mechanics** - Limited engagement options
4. **No Personalization** - Generic experience for all users

### Technical Debt:
- Inconsistent component structure
- No centralized design tokens
- Mixed styling approaches (inline vs. StyleSheet)
- Poor TypeScript typing for components

### Quick Wins Available:
1. Add friend activity to home feed (2 days)
2. Implement one-tap save (1 day)
3. Add haptic feedback (1 day)
4. Fix color consistency (2 days)
5. Add loading skeletons (2 days)
