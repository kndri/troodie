## Overview
Import San Francisco restaurant data into the database to ensure users in SF have a rich set of restaurants to browse and review. This is critical for MVP launch in the SF market.

## Business Value
Having comprehensive restaurant data for San Francisco ensures users see value immediately upon opening the app. Empty or sparse data would result in poor user experience and abandonment.

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Feature: SF restaurant database population
  As a user in San Francisco
  I want to see local restaurants
  So that I can browse and save places near me

  Scenario: Viewing restaurants in SF
    Given I am a user in San Francisco
    When I open the explore screen
    Then I should see a comprehensive list of SF restaurants
    And each restaurant should have:
      - Name and address
      - Cuisine type
      - Price range
      - Basic information (hours if available)

  Scenario: Restaurant data quality
    Given SF restaurants are imported
    When I view any restaurant
    Then the information should be accurate
    And addresses should be properly formatted
    And no duplicate restaurants should exist
```

## Technical Implementation
- Coordinate with TD to get restaurant data source
- Create import script to process restaurant data
- Data should include:
  - Restaurant name
  - Full address
  - Cuisine type/category  
  - Price range ($ to $$$$)
  - Phone number
  - Operating hours (if available)
  - Coordinates for map display
- Implement deduplication logic
- Add data validation and cleaning:
  - Normalize addresses
  - Validate coordinates
  - Clean phone numbers
  - Standardize cuisine types
- Create batch import process
- Add progress tracking for import
- Implement rollback capability
